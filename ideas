ideas:
	water canteen - refill in glade water
	old glade (abandoned) - greenish water, terrrain fucked, creepy,
	tree trunks
	objects come back (grow back)
	vaccine item - serium - infected symbol, less stamina, more hungry
	bleed effects
	bandage items
	reset labyrinth mazes, dont reset loot tho
	dead people
	gas zones (fucked system zones, mazes)- gas mask item - filters (barrel loot) / gas causes bleeding
	fucked glitchy screen when infected, sick
	fishing
	cooking // stove/ uncooked meat in barrel?
	more foods / chocolate bars, drinks
	water / hydratioin bar?	
	epinephrine --- run fast, no stamina cost
